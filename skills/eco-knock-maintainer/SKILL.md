# Eco Knock Maintainer

Use this skill when working on application code in `eco-knock-be-central`.

## Hard Rules

- Read nearby code and package structure before changing or adding files.
- If the implementation language is unclear, ask the user whether to use Java or Kotlin before creating files. Some maintainers may know Java but not Kotlin.
- If the user specifies Java or Kotlin, follow that choice. If nearby files clearly establish a language, match it.
- Do not put files directly under a domain root package such as `{domain}/SomeClass.kt`. Use role packages.
- Do not copy `airquality`'s CQRS/usecase/readmodel shape into other domains unless the user explicitly asks.
- Keep JPA entities in Java under `{domain}/model/entity`.
- Keep enums/value objects stored by entities in Java under `{domain}/model/vo`.
- Do not create `policy`, `evaluator`, `manager`, `helper`, or similar indirection unless reuse or complexity clearly justifies it.
- Keep simple domain decisions inside the owning service as private methods.
- Do not make production methods `public`, `internal`, companion/static, or otherwise wider only to test private implementation.
- Do not use `runBlocking` in Spring controllers, services, or schedulers.
- With blocking gRPC stubs, expose normal functions for normal Spring code. Use `suspend` only for APIs intended to be called from coroutine loops.
- Preserve user or unrelated worktree changes. Never revert unrelated dirty files.
- When adding an HTTP endpoint or changing an endpoint's authorization policy, ask the user whether `GUEST` should be added to the explicit guest allowlist. Do not add it unless the user explicitly approves.

## Package Style

General domains use simple layered packages:

- `controller`: HTTP or SSR entry points.
- `service`: business flow, validation orchestration, and transaction boundaries.
- `repository`: persistence access.
- `dto`, `dto/request`, `dto/response`: transfer types.
- `model/entity`: Java JPA entities.
- `model/vo`: Java value objects/enums embedded in or stored by entities.
- `exception`: domain client exceptions.
- Use `config`, `client`, `resolver`, `messaging`, `queue`, `command`, or `event` only when the domain already needs that role.

Special cases:

- `airquality` already has CQRS-like boundaries. Keep its command/query/usecase/readmodel split.
- `common` contains shared infrastructure only: security, exceptions, response wrappers, converters, utilities, OpenAPI support.
- External integrations such as `sso`, `whozin`, and `grpc` keep integration details under `client`/`config`/`dto`/`service`.

## Language Rules

- Use Java for JPA entities, entity value objects, entity enums, security filters/helpers, low-level security DTOs/constants, and existing Java infrastructure.
- Use Kotlin for services, controllers, repository interfaces, configuration properties, request/response DTOs, external clients, messaging loops, and simple application DTOs when nearby code is Kotlin.
- For mixed Java/Kotlin features, ask the user where they want the boundary if nearby code does not make it obvious.
- Keep Kotlin constructor-injected and concise. Put `companion object` near the top, but limit it to logger, constants, and real factories.

## Implementation Style

- Keep controllers thin: bind input, delegate to service, return `CommonResponse` or a view.
- Keep repositories behind services. Controllers should not call repositories directly.
- Put `@Transactional` on services, not controllers.
- Prefer direct, explicit branches over clever maps or generic helpers.
- Avoid silent correction of invalid input. Throw the owning domain exception.
- Keep request-specific validation in request DTOs.
- Prefer `TargetType.from(source)` factories for DTO conversion.
- Avoid `request.toOtherRequest()` and broad converter classes for one-off mapping.
- For `@ConfigurationProperties`, use public constructor `val` properties and no default values for required operational settings.
- For redirect, auth, token, or cookie behavior, keep logic in service/resolver/helper classes rather than controllers.
- When adding a scheduled or background flow, make repeated execution idempotent and avoid overlapping or noisy side effects.

## Persistence And Migrations

- Hibernate uses `ddl-auto=validate`; every new table/column/entity needs a Flyway migration.
- Add new migrations as the next `V{n}__short_description.sql`. Do not edit applied migrations.
- Match existing physical naming: snake_case table/column names such as `member_id`, `sort_order`, `measured_at`.
- Add indexes for query patterns introduced by the feature.
- Prefer explicit foreign keys when a table owns a real relationship.

## Testing

- Run the narrowest relevant Gradle task first.
- Do not change production visibility just to unit-test private logic.
- Prefer testing public behavior, repository queries, service outcomes, controller responses, or Flyway/JPA validation.
- E2E tests should follow the existing style: `@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = RANDOM_PORT)`, constructor injection, `RestClient`, and bounded test data cleanup.
- Do not mock E2E collaborators unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not add test-only default values for required secrets such as `ADMIN_MASTER_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `AES256_KEY`, `SSO_CLIENT_ID`, or `WHOZIN_TOKEN`.

## Domain Notes

- `overview`: default shortcuts and user shortcuts are separate domains. Use default rows only as reset/init source.
- `auth`: store refresh token `jti` values, not raw refresh tokens. Keep refresh token replacement atomic.
- `sso`: auth-econovation role is not this service's admin role. Validate redirect URLs against the allowlist.
- `whozin`: treat the real API response as source of truth. Preserve snake_case response mapping.
- `light`: persistence is simple save/query around `LightReport`; avoid adding architecture ceremony.
- `grpc`: clients wrap generated stubs and map responses into project DTOs close to the client boundary.
